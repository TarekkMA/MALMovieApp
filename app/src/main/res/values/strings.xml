    <string name="overview_demo">We always knew they were coming back. Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program to protect the planet. But nothing can prepare us for the aliensâ€™ advanced and unprecedented force. Only the ingenuity of a few brave men and women can bring our world back from the brink of extinction.</string>
    <string name="review_demo">Moana is another fine example of how awesome Disney is at animation. Beautiful visuals bring alive a unique world that will make you crave to be on the majestic waters of the pacific islands. In addition, it\'s a very fun movie that contains both laughs and music to instill the positive energy that Disney films love to do around the holidays. Despite all of this though, it wasn\'t the most exciting adventure for me and I really would have liked to see more of the mythology brought into the tale to further develop our lovable characters (and more of the cute pig too). Still, this film is worth visiting in the theaters for all ages and will spread some early holiday joy over you and those you love. </string>
